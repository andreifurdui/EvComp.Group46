Makefile instructions:

All the commands from the tutorial have been included in the makefile for ease of use.

    - Use "make" to compile the project
    - "make submission" will compile the project if not done AND create the submission.jar file
    - "make {function_name}" will compile, create submission file, and test the algorithm on one of the test functions. The function names are: sphere, cigar, kat, schaffers
    - "make tests" will run all 4 tests. Not recommended yet, as katsuura will run forever
    - "make clean" to delete class files
